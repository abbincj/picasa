What is it?
===========

A good-looking frontend for public albums stored in Google Photos (former Google+ or Picasa web), with nice transitions,
mobile device support, and full-screen photo browsing with quick loading (prefetching).

Perfect for those who still want to have a gallery of public albums after transition to Google Photos, which has no public
gallery of it's own anymore.

Example gallery: [Anton Keks Photos](https://photos.azib.net/) - use the link at the bottom to try it with your own gallery!

How does it work?
=================

It's a small app made to be hosted for free on Google App Engine.
It uses [Google Web Albums Data API](https://developers.google.com/picasa-web) to fetch and display your albums and photos, so whenever you change anything
on Google Photos/Picasaweb, it will become visible in this gallery.

Features
========

- Dark theme that emphasizes photos
- Shows your exising public albums, no additional storage needed
- Search within the gallery (by tags, keywords, descriptions, etc) - *currently not working because Google removed this feature from the API*
- Nice bookmarkable URLs for albums, individual photos, search results
- Gallery map if albums are geotagged
- Full-screen photo viewer
- Fast: minimum number of requests, optimized caching, preloading of next photos
- Keyboard navigation
- Mobile device support, eg iPhone, iPad, Android (including touch events)
- Facebook Like buttons for albums and individual photos
- Opengraph metadata (for FB sharing, etc)
- Google analytics support
- Viewing of other people's albums, just add "?by=username" parameter
- Slideshow with adjustable delay, add "#slideshow" to the URL if you want it to start automatically
- Showing of a single (weighted) random photo from all albums, just add "?random" parameter
- ChromeCast support - send currently viewed photo to the TV (provided you own the ChromeCast dongle)

How to use it for your own photos [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angryziber/picasa-gallery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angryziber/picasa-gallery)
=================================

- Clone this repository as described on Github
- Specify your Google username, Google Maps key, etc in `src/config.properties`
- Specify your AppEngine application ID in web/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml
- Uploading and testing
  * `./gradlew appengineUpdate` - will upload the app to Google AppEngine
  * `./gradlew appengineRun` - will run the app locally on port 8080
- Or, the app is a standard Java Servlet-based application, so it will work with any other Servlet Container  
  * `./gradlew war` - will build the war file (web application archive)

- If you use Intellij IDEA, you can import `build.gradle` and run all the actions from an IDE.
